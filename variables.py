COT_PROMPT = """Analyze the code and determine if it contains any vulnerabilities step by step.
1. Examine overall the structure of the code to understand its purpose and functionality.
2. Assess user input handling & data flow. Determine how inputs are received and processed (e.g., user input, file input, API request). Track data flow to check if input validation/sanitization is missing or insufficient.
3. Analyze the code to check if it contains any vulnerabilities.
- If a vulnerability is identified, proceed to steps 4â€“7.
- If no vulnerabilities are found, the output the following JSON format:
{{
  "reasoning": "Detailed explanation of why the code is safe.",
  "cwe_id": None
}} 

4. Identify which part of the code could cause vulnerabilty. 
5. Explain why the identified area might be vulnerable, providing a detailed explanation referencing CWE descriptions.
6. Based on the analysis, identify the CWE category id.
7. Respond with the following JSON format.

Sample 1: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
```
$userName = $_POST["user"];
$command = 'ls -l /home/' . $userName;

```
Sample 1 Output:
{{
  "reason": "The $userName variable is not checked for malicious input. An attacker could set the $userName variable to an arbitrary OS command such as: ;rm -rf /",

Sample 2: CWE-89: Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
```
$servername = "localhost";

$password = "password";
$dbname = "myDB";
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

Sample 2 Output:

Sample 3: CWE-434: Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
```
$target_dir = "uploads/";

Sample 3 Output:

  "reason": "The code does not properly validate the file type before uploading. An attacker could upload a malicious file that could be executed on the server.",

Sample 4: CWE-352: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
```
<form action="http://example.com/transfer" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
  <input type="hidden" name="to" value="attacker_account">

Sample 4 Output:

Sample 5: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
```

int quantity = currentUser.getAttribute("quantity");
double total = price * quantity;

Sample 5 Output:

  "reason": "The code does not validate the input quantity, which can be manipulated by an attacker to perform a business logic attack. This can lead to undercharging or overcharging the user.",

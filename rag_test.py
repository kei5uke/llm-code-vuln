cot_prompt = """You are a security expert tasked with identifying vulnerabilities in a given code. Carefully analyze the code using CWE (Common Weakness Enumeration) descriptions and determine if it contains any vulnerabilities step by step.
For each step:
1. Examine overall the structure of the code to understand its purpose and functionality.
2. Assess User Input Handling & Data Flow. Determine how inputs are received and processed (e.g., user input, file input, API request). Track data flow to check if input validation/sanitization is missing or insufficient.
3. Analyze the code to check if it contains any vulnerabilities.
  - If a vulnerability is identified, proceed to steps 4â€“7.
  - If no vulnerabilities are found, the output must be strictly:
{
  "is_this_vuln": False,
  "vuln_code_part": None,
  "reason": "Detailed explanation of why the code is safe.",
  "cwe": None
} 

4. Identify the name of function in the code that could be exploited. You can refer to the function name or the code snippet that could be exploited. 
5. Explain why the identified area might be vulnerable, providing a detailed explanation referencing CWE descriptions.
6. Based on the analysis, identify the CWE category and include its ID, name, and description.
7. Respond only with the following JSON format.

Output Requirements:

  "is_this_vuln": True,
  "vuln_code_part": "the code snippet that could be exploited.",
  "reason": "Detailed explanation of why the code is vulnerable.",
